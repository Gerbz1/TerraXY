# TerraXY
inspired by panda-mini, SnakeOilXY, ratrig and Voron. Thank you for opensourcing your work!

TerraXY is an opensource, small footprint, fast 3d printer designed and built by deBlauwe and I. The goal was to maintain the 230x230mm build area of an ender-3 but to make it faster, more reliable and to keep it compact.

# Goals
The cornerstones of the design are:
- Use off the shelf or 3d printed parts
- Stay under €400 when upgrading an ender 3 for parts or 500 when building from scratch
- Use ender-3 parts to keep the cost down
- Run klipper and an web interface
- Keep the gantry weight down.

Special thanks to Chip for answering some of my questions, I really appreciate it!
